# CKT-LEDPANEL
Lithion Ion Battery-Powered Constant Current LED Boost Driver for Light Panel

## Project Background

Back in 2018, I came up with the idea for a battery-powered backlit display
cabinet to take with me to insulator shows.  The traditional solutions were
heavy cabinets with fluorescent tubes and ballasts that required line power.
By combining side-lit LED light panels intended for drop ceilings and high capacity lithium ion tool
batteries, building a small, light cabinet that would run entirely on battery power
was well within reach.

The CKT-LEDPANEL will drive a standard 30-38V panel at 300mA, which is more
than bright enough for a cabinet backlight.  It includes safety circuits to
prevent over-discharge of "20V" (5 series cell) lithium ion tool batteries,
such as those available from Dewalt.  It also provides convenient connectors
for an on/off switch and an 18VDC wall power supply input.

## Cabinet Construction Instructions

Instructions for constructing the cabinets and wiring everything up
(including the CKT-LEDPANEL) can be found [on my personal
